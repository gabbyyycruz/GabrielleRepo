    "\n",
    "This quiz will be credited to Class Participation. It is over 20 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "1. Answer the questions below in the code box below the question. Follow the question carefully to avoid unnecessary deductions. If the question asks for a function, provide a function; if it asks for your function to return, then return, not print.\n",
    "2. You are allowed to submit this quiz in groups of 4 (maximum). Indicate your names in the given cell below this instruction cell. You are allowed to answer the quiz with fewer people (or even individually), but this is not recommended for difficulty reasons.\n",
    "3. This quiz file should have been uploaded on 19 June 2019 from any time between 9:20 AM to 9:30 AM. It is due in the inbox of joben.ilagan@gmail.com at 11:10 AM **at the latest**. Any quiz file sent between 11:11 AM and 12:10 PM will have the final score slashed in half. Any quiz file sent after 12:10 PM will not be accepted.\n",
    "4. If Joe uploaded the file after 9:30, then all deadlines move back one hour.\n",
    "5. The file name should be: **GroupLeaderLastName_Quiz_1.ipynb**"

    "The Caesar cipher is a very basic method of encrypting text. This is how to encrypt a message using the Caesar cipher:\n",
    "1. First, pick a message. \n",
    "2. Second, pick a number. \n",
    "3. Shift the alphabet right by the number that you chose.\n",
    "4. Replace each letter in the message with the new letter based on the shifted alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to encrypt \"ABC\" with the number 3, shift each letter right by 3. In this case, \"ABC\" becomes \"DEF\" because D comes 3 letters after A, E comes 3 letters after B, and F comes 3 letters after C. Letters near the end of the alphabet simply wrap around: \"WXYZ\" encrypted with the number 2 would yield the encrypted message \"YZAB\".\n",
